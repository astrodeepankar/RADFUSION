**RADFUSION** is a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Horizon Europe Fellowship project (2024 call) dedicated to the **multi-scale modeling and predictive analysis of fusion-relevant materials** under extreme radiation and plasma environments.

This repository hosts all code and documentation related to simulation workflows, predictive models, and data analysis developed throughout the project (2025‚Äì2027).

##  Project Overview

The project bridges atomic-scale physics and mesoscopic phenomena using an integrated approach:

- **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** using [GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/)
- **Radiation Transport Modeling** using [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/)
- **Machine Learning** and **Bayesian Neural Networks** for predictive modeling
- **Combined Multiscale Framework** connecting atomic calculations with material-level predictions

##  Research Objectives

- Simulate **irradiation damage** and **plasma-material interactions** in W-based alloys
- Understand defect evolution and microstructure changes across scales
- Predict **material properties** (mechanical, thermal, electronic) using ML
- Design **radiation-tolerant fusion materials** through integrated modeling
